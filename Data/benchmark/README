The benchmark*.txt files provide detailed statistics for the 40,000,320 sampled tile sets used to evaluate software performance. Below is a description of each field in the file:

SET1: The tile set assigned to the first player, which always includes the largest double tile.
SET2: The tile set assigned to the second player.
#LEAVES: The total number of leaves in the game tree for the match.
#BLOCK: The number of possible matches that end in a block condition (i.e., no player can make a move).
MM: The outcome of the Minimax algorithm, assuming perfect information and optimal play by both players.
MIN: The minimum leaf value in the game tree.
AVG: The average leaf value in the game tree.
SD: The standard deviation of the leaf values, indicating the variability in outcomes.
MAX: The maximum leaf value in the game tree.
WIN1: The number of possible matches won by Player 1 (i.e., leaves with a score > 0).
DRAW: The number of possible draws (i.e., leaves with a score = 0).
WIN2: The number of possible matches won by Player 2 (i.e., leaves with a score < 0).

For the head-to-head comparison tests, a set of tiles was selected where the game tree contains at least 4,000 leaves (i.e., #LEAVES >= 4000).
